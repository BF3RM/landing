    <p>
      Hi there. My name is Stefan Roos aka. 3ti65, and I'm the co-founder and
      project lead behind BF3: Reality Mod. I want to give you a brief overview
      on how the project came together and evolved over the past almost 6 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been always a big fan of the total conversion Battlefield 2 'Project
      Reality' mod and I had played it since version 0.5 (I was only about 14
      years old back then). Ever since then, I had not experienced anything even
      remotely as immersive and exciting as PR. In terms of the community,
      coordinated teamplay, communication, tactics and strategy, there was
      nothing that came close to that experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, the game became rather antiquated and the quality of the
      community also declined quite a bit. With no modding tools provided to any
      Battlefield game after BF2142, there was no way to recreate the same
      experience on a more modern platform, and no commercial game was able to
      fill the spot to my satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in 2015 I came across the BF3 modding platform Venice Unleashed,
      which back then was in its infancy and had just had its initial release.
      Seeing the (back then quite limited) modding possibilities, I wondered
      whether it would be possible to create a remake of Project Reality. I came
      across Mats Bakken aka. Powback and together we started throwing together
      different proof of concepts of how to change different gameplay aspects.
      We modified weapon handling, movement speed, etc. for almost a year before
      we decided it would be sufficient enough to actually get started with the
      implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that time, Fulgen Ruiz aka. FoolHen joined the team and together we
      pushed the implementation of our proof of concepts as well as a new UI and
      additional features. Ever since then the team grew steadily with new
      developers, designers, testers, etc. joining the team and contributing to
      the common vision. At the time of this writing, more than 70 volunteers
      from all over the world have contributed to this unique project in one way
      or another. We have overcome an incredible amount of obstacles together,
      be that from an engineering perspective or on a personal level.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were forced to delay the release several times due to some gamebreaking
      issues and a functioning VoIP solution. After spending so much time on it,
      we felt that it would be an injustice to all our hard work to release the
      game in a unworthy state. In retrospect, we managed to use that additional
      time to a great affect, implementing additional features such as a sound
      system revamping, a dynamic weather system and a complete new gunshots and
      explosion suppression system.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, the long work and the long wait for the players have been
      worth it in our opinion, but you'll be the judge on that with our upcoming
      initial release. If you want to join the team and contribute in any way,
      hit us up on our discord!
